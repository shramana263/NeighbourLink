# NeighbourLink Business Component - Modular Architecture

## Overview
The original `NeighbourLinkBusiness.tsx` component has been refactored into a modular architecture for better maintainability, reusability, and testing.

## Structure

### Main Components

#### 1. `NeighbourLinkBusinessModular.tsx`
The main component that orchestrates all sub-components. This is the entry point that:
- Uses the custom hook for business logic
- Renders all sub-components
- Handles the overall layout and structure

#### 2. `hooks/useBusinessLogic.ts`
A custom hook that contains all the business logic, including:
- State management
- API calls (Firebase operations)
- Event handlers
- File upload/download logic
- Promotion management
- Form handling

#### 3. `types.ts`
Contains all TypeScript interfaces and types used across the business components:
- `BusinessCollection`
- `Review`
- `PromotionFormData`

### Sub-Components

#### 4. `components/BusinessHeroSection.tsx`
Handles the top section of the business page:
- Business name and description editing
- Profile and cover image management
- Basic business information display
- Statistics overview

#### 5. `components/ServicesSection.tsx`
Manages the services section:
- Service listing
- Add/edit/remove services
- Service promotion functionality

#### 6. `components/ProductsSection.tsx`
Manages the products section:
- Product listing
- Add/edit/remove products
- Product promotion functionality

#### 7. `components/ContactInfoSection.tsx`
Handles contact and payment information:
- Phone number management
- Payment details
- Contact verification status

#### 8. `components/QuickActionsSection.tsx`
Provides quick action buttons:
- View insights
- Gallery management
- Verification documents

#### 9. `components/StatisticsReviewsSection.tsx`
Displays customer reviews and statistics:
- Review listing with ratings
- Statistics display
- Empty state handling

#### 10. `components/WarningCard.tsx`
Reusable warning/notification component:
- Configurable icon and message
- Action button support
- Consistent styling

#### 11. `components/StarRating.tsx`
Reusable star rating display component:
- Configurable rating value
- Responsive design
- Accessible

#### 12. `components/Modals.tsx`
Contains all modal dialogs:
- Statistics modal
- Gallery drawer
- Consistent modal behavior

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Cleaner code organization

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Consistent UI patterns across the app
- Reduced code duplication

### 3. **Testing**
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Easier to write unit tests
- Better test coverage

### 4. **Performance**
- Components can be lazy-loaded if needed
- Better bundle splitting opportunities
- Optimized re-renders

### 5. **Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different components
- Clearer code ownership
- Reduced merge conflicts

## Usage

### Using the Modular Component
```tsx
import NeighbourLinkBusinessModular from './components/bussiness/NeighbourLinkBusinessModular';

function App() {
  return <NeighbourLinkBusinessModular />;
}
```

### Using Individual Components
```tsx
import { 
  BusinessHeroSection, 
  ServicesSection, 
  WarningCard 
} from './components/bussiness/components';

// Use components individually in other parts of your app
```

### Using the Custom Hook
```tsx
import { useBusinessLogic } from './components/bussiness/hooks/useBusinessLogic';

function MyCustomBusinessComponent() {
  const { businessData, loading, handleAddService } = useBusinessLogic();
  
  // Use the business logic in your custom component
}
```

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the original component to the modular version:

1. Replace imports:
   ```tsx
   // Old
   import NeighbourLinkBusiness from './components/bussiness/NeighbourLinkBusiness';
   
   // New
   import NeighbourLinkBusiness from './components/bussiness/NeighbourLinkBusinessModular';
   ```

2. The component API remains the same, so no props changes are needed.

3. If you were extending the original component, consider:
   - Using individual sub-components
   - Extending the custom hook
   - Creating new components using the existing types

## Future Enhancements

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components can be lazy-loaded for better performance
2. **Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries around each section
3. **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility features in each component
4. **Animation**: Add smooth transitions between states
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize components for mobile devices
6. **State Management**: Consider adding Redux or Zustand for complex state scenarios
